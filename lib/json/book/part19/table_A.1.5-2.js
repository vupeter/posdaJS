datab = [{},{" Name ":" DicomAttribute "," Optionality ":" O "," Cardinality ":" 0-n "," Description ":" An Infoset element corresponding to each DICOM Attribute. "},{" Name ":" >keyword "," Optionality ":" C "," Cardinality ":" A "," Description ":" The keyword as defined in . Required unless the DICOM Data Element is unknown to the host. "},{" Name ":" >tag "," Optionality ":" R "," Cardinality ":" A "," Description ":" The four-digit zero-padded hexadecimal values of the Group and Element Numbers of the Data Element Tag, concatenated as a single string without a delimiter and with lowercase letters disallowed. E.g., Data Element (0010,0020) would have a tag of \"00100020\". For Private Data Elements, the two most significant hexadecimal characters of the Element Number shall be 00, since the Private Creator is explicitly conveyed and the block used in the DICOM encoding shall not be sent (i.e., a Private Data Element has the form gggg00ee). "},{" Name ":" >vr "," Optionality ":" O "," Cardinality ":" A "," Description ":" The Value Representation of this element, represented as a two character uppercase string, as defined in  and specified for this Data Element in .  Implementations may utilize the Value Representation to validate data values, if desired.  "},{" Name ":" >privateCreator "," Optionality ":" C "," Cardinality ":" A "," Description ":" The value of the Private Creator Data Element corresponding to the block in which this Private Data Element is used. Required for Private Data Elements. Shall not be present otherwise (i.e., for Data Elements defined by the DICOM Standard). "},{" Name ":" >Value "," Optionality ":" C "," Cardinality ":" 1-n "," Description ":" A Value from the Value Field of the DICOM Data Element. There is one Infoset Value element for each DICOM Value or Sequence Item. Required if the DICOM Data Element represented is not zero length and an Item, PersonName, InlineBinary or BulkData XML element is not present. Shall not be used if the VR of the enclosing Attribute is either SQ or PN. "},{" Name ":" >>number "," Optionality ":" R "," Cardinality ":" A "," Description ":" The order in which the Value occurs within the DICOM Value Field, as a number monotonically increasing starting from 1 by 1.  The Number XML Attribute is used to preserve the original order.  "},{" Name ":" >> plain character data  "," Optionality ":" C "," Cardinality ":" 1 "," Description ":" A single DICOM value encoded as plain character data. E.g., a DICOM Decimal String Value Field that contained two delimiter-separated values, e.g., \"0.5\\0.4\" would be encoded as two Infoset Value elements:<Value number=\"1\">0.5</Value><Value number=\"2\">0.4</Value>A Code String Value Field that containing three delimiter-separated values, the second of which was zero length, \"MPG\\\\XR3\", would be encoded as:<Value number=\"1\">MPG</Value><Value number=\"2\"></Value><Value number=\"3\">XR3</Value>Contrast the latter example with a zero length Value Field, in which case there would be no Infoset Value elements at all. For DICOM Data Elements whose VR is AT, each value shall be encoded as the four-digit zero-padded hexadecimal values of the Group and Element Numbers of the Data Element Tag, concatenated as a single string without a delimiter and with lowercase letters disallowed. The character encoding is that declared for the Infoset, regardless of any DICOM Specific Character Set, and any necessary translation from the DICOM Specific Character Set to the Infoset character encoding shall have been performed.  This translation might not be completely lossless, particularly with Asian character sets.  "},{" Name ":" >Item "," Optionality ":" C "," Cardinality ":" 1-n "," Description ":" A DICOM sequence item, in other words a nested DICOM Data Set. Required if the DICOM Data Element represented is a Sequence (has a VR of \"SQ\") and is not zero length. Not allowed otherwise. "},{" Name ":" >>number "," Optionality ":" R "," Cardinality ":" A "," Description ":" The order in which the Item occurs within a Sequence of Items, as a number monotonically increasing from 1 by 1.  The Number XML Attribute is used to preserve the original order.  "},{" Name ":" >>Include    "," Optionality ":" R "," Cardinality ":" 1 "," Description ":" Recursively includes the Data Set corresponding to a Sequence Item. "},{" Name ":" >PersonName "," Optionality ":" C "," Cardinality ":" 1-n "," Description ":" A parsed representation in XML of a DICOM Data Element containing a name (i.e., whose VR is PN).  Parsing Attributes with a VR of PN into an XML representation of the name groups and components simplifies the creation of XPath statements to pull only portions of names out of the DICOM data.  Required if the DICOM Data Element represented has a VR of PN and is not zero length. Not allowed otherwise. The rules defined in DICOM  on the usage of the Alphabetic, Ideographic, and Phonetic groups of name components within a DICOM Attribute with a Value Representation of PN apply. "},{" Name ":" >>number "," Optionality ":" R "," Cardinality ":" A "," Description ":" The order in which the PersonName occurs within the DICOM Value Field, as a number monotonically increasing from 1 by 1.  The Number XML Attribute is used to preserve the original order.  "},{" Name ":" >>Alphabetic "," Optionality ":" O "," Cardinality ":" 0-1 "," Description ":" A group of name components that are represented in alphabetical characters (see the definition for the Value Representation of PN in ). "},{" Name ":" >>>Include    "},{" Name ":" >>Ideographic "," Optionality ":" O "," Cardinality ":" 0-1 "," Description ":" A group of name components that are represented in ideographic characters (see the definition for the Value Representation of PN in ). "},{" Name ":" >>>Include    "},{" Name ":" >>Phonetic "," Optionality ":" O "," Cardinality ":" 0-1 "," Description ":" A group of name components that are represented in phonetic characters (see the definition for the Value Representation of PN in ). "},{" Name ":" >>>Include    "},{" Name ":" >BulkData "," Optionality ":" C "," Cardinality ":" 1 "," Description ":" A reference to a blob of data that the recipient may retrieve through use of the GetData() method, a WADO-RS call or a STOW-RS call. Required if the DICOM Data Element represented is not zero length and an XML Infoset Value, Item, InlineBinary or PersonName element is not present. The provider of the data may use a BulkData reference at its discretion to avoid encoding a large DICOM Value Field as text by value in the Infoset. For example, pixel data or look up tables. There is a single BulkData Infoset element representing the entire Value Field, and not one per Value in the case where the Value Multiplicity is greater than one.  E.g., a LUT with 4096 16 bit entries that may be encoded in DICOM with a Value Representation of OW, with a VL of 8192 and a VM of 1, or a US VR with a VL of 8192 and a VM of 4096 would both be represented as a single BulkData element.  All rules (e.g., byte ordering and swapping) in  apply.  Implementers should in particular pay attention the  rules regarding the value representations of OD, OF, OL and OW.  If the BulkData has a string or text Value Representation, the value(s) of the DICOM Specific Character Set Data Element, if present, might be necessary to determine its encoding. "},{" Name ":" >>uuid "," Optionality ":" C "," Cardinality ":" A "," Description ":" An identifier of this bulk data reference formatted as a UUID using the hexadecimal representation defined in ITU-T Recommendation X.667. Required if BulkData URI is not present. Shall not be present otherwise. "},{" Name ":" >>uri "," Optionality ":" C "," Cardinality ":" A "," Description ":" The HTTP(S) URI for this bulk data reference. Required if the NativeDicomModel was:   returned in response to a WADO-RS Retrieve Metadata request   Shall not be present otherwise. "},{" Name ":" >InlineBinary "," Optionality ":" C "," Cardinality ":" 1 "," Description ":" The Value Field of the enclosing Attribute encoded as base64. Required if the DICOM Data Element represented is:   not zero length   the VR if the enclosing Attribute is either OB, OD, OF, OW, or UN   an XML Infoset Value or BulkData XML element is not present   Shall not be present otherwise. There is a single InlineBinary Infoset element representing the entire Value Field, and not one per Value in the case where the Value Multiplicity is greater than one.  E.g., a LUT with 4096 16 bit entries that may be encoded in DICOM with a Value Representation of OW with a VL of 8192 and a VM of 1 would be represented as a single InlineBinary element.  All rules (e.g., byte ordering and swapping) in  apply.  Implementers should in particular pay attention to the  rules regarding the value representations of OD, OF, OL and OW.  "}];
