The units of this Attribute is the same as defined in Measurement Units Code Sequence (0040,08EA) of the Wide Field Ophthalmic Photography Quality Rating Sequence (0022,1525). The threshold value is not the same as the attribute Numeric Value (0049,A30A) of the Wide Field Ophthalmic Photography Quality Rating Sequence (0022,1525).
