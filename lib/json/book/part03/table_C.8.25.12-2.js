The value is derived from two values in a fraction where the numerator of the fraction is the nominal distance to the chart that the patient is reading. The denominator represents the line of smallest optotypes of which the patient can see more than half.    Typical examples: reference standard is 1, severe vision loss is 0.1   See  for guidance in converting Decimal Visual Acuity to other customarily used display notation such as 20/20 in the US and 6/6 in Britain."}},{"Attribute Name":{"colspan":"1","rowspan":"1","text":"Visual Acuity Modifiers"},"Tag":{"colspan":"1","rowspan":"1","text":"(0046,0135)"},"Type":{"colspan":"1","rowspan":"1","text":"3"},"Attribute Description":{"colspan":"1","rowspan":"1","text":"The first value is a positive or negative integer numeric value such as +1, +2, +3, 0, -1, -2, or -3 used to indicate that the patient missed letters on the line referenced, or saw additional letters on the next smaller line.
