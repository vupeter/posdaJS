datab = [{},{"Attribute Name":"Spacing Between Slices","Tag":"(0018,0088)","Type":"2","Attribute Description":"Spacing between slices, in mm, measured from center-to-center of each slice along the normal to the first image. The sign of the Spacing Between Slices (0018,0088) determines the direction of stacking. The normal is determined by the cross product of the direction cosines of the first row and first column of the first frame, such that a positive spacing indicates slices are stacked behind the first slice and a negative spacing indicates slices are stacked in front of the first slice. See Image Orientation (0020,0037) in the NM Detector module."},{"Attribute Name":"Reconstruction Diameter","Tag":"(0018,1100)","Type":"3","Attribute Description":"Diameter, in mm, of the region from within which the data was used in creating the reconstruction of the image. Data may exist outside this region and portions of the patient may exist outside this region."},{"Attribute Name":"Convolution Kernel","Tag":"(0018,1210)","Type":"3","Attribute Description":"A label describing the convolution kernel or algorithm used to reconstruct the data."},{"Attribute Name":"Slice Thickness","Tag":"(0018,0050)","Type":"2","Attribute Description":"Nominal slice thickness, in mm."},{"Attribute Name":"Slice Location","Tag":"(0020,1041)","Type":"3","Attribute Description":"Relative position of the image plane expressed in mm. See  for further explanation."},{"Attribute Name":"Slice Progression Direction","Tag":"(0054,0500)","Type":"3","Attribute Description":"Describes the anatomical direction that slices are progressing as the slices are considered in order (as defined by Slice Vector (0054,0080)). Meaningful only for cardiac images. When View Code Sequence (0054,0220) indicates a short axis view, then the Enumerated Values are:  Enumerated Values:  APEX_TO_BASE      BASE_TO_APEX"}];
