datab = [{},{" Attribute Name ":" PET Frame Acquisition Sequence "," Tag ":" (0018,9732) "," Type ":" 1 "," Attribute Description ":" Contains the attributes defining the PET acquisition mode. Only a single Item shall be included in this Sequence. "},{" Attribute Name ":" >Table Height "," Tag ":" (0018,1130) "," Type ":" 1 "," Attribute Description ":" The distance in mm from the top of the patient table to the data collection center. The distance is positive when the table is below the data collection center. "},{" Attribute Name ":" >Gantry/Detector Tilt "," Tag ":" (0018,1120) "," Type ":" 1 "," Attribute Description ":" Nominal angle of tilt in degrees of the scanning gantry. Not intended for mathematical computations. Zero degrees means the gantry is not tilted, negative degrees are when the top of the gantry is tilted away from where the table enters the gantry. "},{" Attribute Name ":" >Gantry/Detector Slew "," Tag ":" (0018,1121) "," Type ":" 1 "," Attribute Description ":" Nominal angle of slew in degrees of the gantry. Not intended for mathematical computations. Zero degrees means the gantry is no slewed. Positive slew is moving the gantry on the patient's left toward the patient's superior, when the patient is supine. "},{" Attribute Name ":" >Data Collection Diameter "," Tag ":" (0018,0090) "," Type ":" 1 "," Attribute Description ":" The diameter in mm of the region over which data were collected. See . "}];
