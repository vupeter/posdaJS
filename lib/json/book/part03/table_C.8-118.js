Only a single Item shall be included in this Sequence."},{"Attribute Name":">Acquisition Type","Tag":"(0018,9302)","Type":"1C","Attribute Description":"Description of the method used during acquisition of this frame. See  for Defined Terms. Required if Frame Type (0008,9007) Value 1 of this frame is ORIGINAL. May be present otherwise."},{"Attribute Name":">Tube Angle","Tag":"(0018,9303)","Type":"1C","Attribute Description":"The constant angle at which the x-ray source is located during acquisition. 0 degrees means that the source is located at the highest point of the gantry orbit. Degrees increase from 0 to positive 360 in a clockwise direction as viewed when facing the gantry where the table enters the gantry.
