This value may be different from Pixel Spacing (0028,0030) or Imager Pixel Spacing (0018,1164) specified in the referenced image, which are ignored, since some form of calibration may have been performed (for example by reference to an object of known size in the image).   If the row and column spacing are different, then the pixel aspect ratio of the image is not 1:1.    Required if Presentation Size Mode (0070,0100) is TRUE SIZE, in which case the values will correspond to the physical distance between the center of each pixel on the display device.

Required if Presentation Size Mode (0070,0100) is MAGNIFY.    A value of 1.0 would imply that one pixel in the referenced image would be displayed as one pixel on the display (i.e., it would not be interpolated if the aspect ratio of the image pixels is 1:1).   A value of 2.0 would imply that one pixel in the referenced image would be displayed as 4 pixels on the display (i.e., up-sampled by a factor of 2 in each of the row and column directions).   A value of 0.5 would imply that 4 pixels in the referenced image would be displayed as 1 pixel on the display (i.e., down-sampled by a factor of 2 in each of the row and column directions).   If the source pixels have an aspect ratio of other than 1:1, then they are assumed to have been interpolated to a display pixel aspect ratio of 1:1 prior to magnification."}];
