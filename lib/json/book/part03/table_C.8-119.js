datab = [{},{" Attribute Name ":" CT Acquisition Details Sequence "," Tag ":" (0018,9304) "," Type ":" 1 "," Attribute Description ":" Contains the attributes defining the details of the acquisition. Only a single Item shall be included in this Sequence. "},{" Attribute Name ":" >Rotation Direction "," Tag ":" (0018,1140) "," Type ":" 1C "," Attribute Description ":" Direction of rotation of the source about the gantry, as viewed while facing the gantry where the table enters the gantry.  Enumerated Values:  CW  clockwise    CC  counter clockwise    Required if Frame Type (0008,9007) Value 1 of this frame is ORIGINAL and Acquisition Type (0018,9302) is other than CONSTANT_ANGLE. Otherwise may be present if Frame Type (0008,9007) Value 1 of this frame is DERIVED and Acquisition Type (0018,9302) is other than CONSTANT_ANGLE. "},{" Attribute Name ":" >Revolution Time "," Tag ":" (0018,9305) "," Type ":" 1C "," Attribute Description ":" The time in seconds of a complete revolution of the source around the gantry orbit. This value is independent of the Reconstruction Angle (0018,9319) of the frame. Required if Frame Type (0008,9007) Value 1 of this frame is ORIGINAL and Acquisition Type (0018,9302) is other than CONSTANT_ANGLE. Otherwise may be present if Frame Type (0008,9007) Value 1 of this frame is DERIVED and Acquisition Type (0018,9302) is other than CONSTANT_ANGLE. "},{" Attribute Name ":" >Single Collimation Width "," Tag ":" (0018,9306) "," Type ":" 1C "," Attribute Description ":" The width of a single row of acquired data (in mm).  Adjacent physical detector rows may have been combined to form a single effective acquisition row.  Required if Frame Type (0008,9007) Value 1 of this frame is ORIGINAL. May be present otherwise. "},{" Attribute Name ":" >Total Collimation Width "," Tag ":" (0018,9307) "," Type ":" 1C "," Attribute Description ":" The width of the total collimation (in mm) over the area of active x-ray detection.  This will be equal to the number of effective detector rows multiplied by single collimation width.  Required if Frame Type (0008,9007) Value 1 of this frame is ORIGINAL. May be present otherwise. "},{" Attribute Name ":" >Table Height "," Tag ":" (0018,1130) "," Type ":" 1C "," Attribute Description ":" The distance in mm from the top of the patient table to the center of rotation of the source (i.e., the data collection center or isocenter). The distance is positive when the table is below the data collection center. Required if Frame Type (0008,9007) Value 1 of this frame is ORIGINAL. May be present otherwise. "},{" Attribute Name ":" >Gantry/Detector Tilt "," Tag ":" (0018,1120) "," Type ":" 1C "," Attribute Description ":" Nominal angle of tilt in degrees of the scanning gantry. Not intended for mathematical computations. Zero degrees means the gantry is not tilted, negative degrees are when the top of the gantry is tilted away from where the table enters the gantry. Required if Frame Type (0008,9007) Value 1 of this frame is ORIGINAL. May be present otherwise. "},{" Attribute Name ":" >Data Collection Diameter "," Tag ":" (0018,0090) "," Type ":" 1C "," Attribute Description ":" The diameter in mm of the region over which data were collected. See .  In the case of an Acquisition Type (0018,9302) of CONSTANT_ANGLE, the diameter is that in a plane normal to the central ray of the diverging X-Ray beam as it passes through the data collection center.  Required if Frame Type (0008,9007) Value 1 of this frame is ORIGINAL. May be present otherwise. "}];
