datab = [{},{"Enumerated Value Name":"VOLUME","Enumerated Value Description":"Image contains pixels that represent the volume specified for the image (Examples: Volume Based Calculation Technique (0008,9207) is NONE or MPR)."},{"Enumerated Value Name":"SAMPLED","Enumerated Value Description":"The specified frame or each frame within the image will not contain a representation of the average information in the slice direction because the frame was calculated by the non-linear re-sampling of a volume where each pixels of the resulting frame does not contain an average representation of the voxel represented by the frame's pixel. For example a projection (MAX_IP) frame uses the maximum value along a ray for each pixel rather than the average value of the represented voxel."},{"Enumerated Value Name":"DISTORTED","Enumerated Value Description":"Image contains significantly distorted information from what is specified by the image volume attributes. For example this image should not be used in planning or for 3D volume. An example of this image type is a curved reformatted image (CURVED_MPR)."},{"Enumerated Value Name":"MIXED","Enumerated Value Description":"Used only as a value in Volumetric Properties (0008,9206) in the  or  if frames within the image SOP Instance contain different values for Volumetric Properties (0008,9206) in the MR Image Frame Type Functional Group or CT Frame Type Functional Group."}];
