This value is intended to provide a single location where manufacturer specific information can be found for annotation on a display or film, that has meaning to a knowledgeable observer.   This may be a calculated or measured value. Examples are the detector entrance dose (KB) , the CR sensitivity value (S), or the logarithmic median (lgM).
