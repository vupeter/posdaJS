Only a single Item shall be included in this Sequence. Required if the right eye is measured.    Consideration for steep, flat, and spherical meridians is made. For instances where spherical keratometric measurements are obtained, values specified in the steep and flat Attributes are equivalent.   If Keratometry Right Eye Sequence (0046,0070) is present, Measurement Laterality (0024,0113), if present, will have a value of R or B as appropriate."},{"Attribute Name":">Include","Tag":""},{"Attribute Name":"Keratometry Left Eye Sequence","Tag":"(0046,0071)","Type":"1C","Attribute Description":"A sequence that specifies keratometric measurements of a patient's left eye, defining principal meridians wherein the steepest meridian is separated by 90 degrees from the flattest.
