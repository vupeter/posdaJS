The units of this Attribute is the same as defined in Measurement Unit Code Sequence (0040,08EA) of the Ophthalmic Thickness Map Quality Rating Sequence (0022,1470). The threshold value is not the same as the attribute Numeric Value (0049,A30A) of the Ophthalmic Thickness Map Quality Rating Sequence (0022,1470). Therefore, it conveys the least stringent value that is acceptable, not the actual rating for this SOP Instance.  "},{" Attribute Name ":"  >>Include    "," Tag ":"  "}];
