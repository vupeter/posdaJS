datab = [{},{"Attribute Name":"Projection Pixel Calibration Sequence","Tag":"(0018,9401)","Type":"1","Attribute Description":"A sequence that describes the geometrical position of the patient relative to the equipment. Only a single Item shall be included in this Sequence."},{"Attribute Name":">Distance Object to Table Top","Tag":"(0018,9403)","Type":"2","Attribute Description":"Distance between the anatomic region of interest of observation and table top in mm.    This value is always positive, the object is assumed to be above the table.   The value of this attribute is depending on the patient position on the tabletop (supine, left or right decubitus, etc.)"},{"Attribute Name":">Object Pixel Spacing in Center of Beam","Tag":"(0018,9404)","Type":"1C","Attribute Description":"Physical distance within the anatomic region of interest in the center of the beam and perpendicular to the beam between the center of each pixel, specified by a numeric pair adjacent row spacing (delimiter) adjacent column spacing in mm. See . See  for further explanation of the value order. Required if Distance Object to Table Top (0018,9403) is not empty.  This value is provided besides the values that are the input parameters of the calibration algorithm."},{"Attribute Name":">Table Height","Tag":"(0018,1130)","Type":"1C","Attribute Description":"The distance of the top of the patient table to the center of rotation of the source (i.e., the isocenter) in mm. A positive value indicates that the tabletop is below the isocenter.  All the distances are measured perpendicular to the Table Top plane.  Required if Image Type (0008,0008) Value 1 is ORIGINAL, may be present otherwise."},{"Attribute Name":">Beam Angle","Tag":"(0018,9449)","Type":"1C","Attribute Description":"The equipment related angle in degrees of the X-Ray beam relative to the perpendicular to the tabletop plane. An angle from 0 to +90 degrees indicates that the X-Ray source is below the table. The valid range is 0 to +180 degrees. Required if Image Type (0008,0008) Value 1 is ORIGINAL, may be present otherwise."}];
