datab = [{},{" Attribute Name ":" Rotation Information Sequence "," Tag ":" (0054,0052) "," Type ":" 2 "," Attribute Description ":" Sequence of Items that describe TOMO rotational groups. A new rotation is defined whenever the direction of the detector motion changes, or Table Traverse (0018,1131) changes. Zero or more Items shall be included in this Sequence. The number of items shall be equal to Number of Rotations (0054,0051). If Rotation Vector (0054,0050) is present, the first item corresponds to frames with value of 1 in Rotation Vector (0054,0050), the second item with value 2, etc. "},{" Attribute Name ":" >Start Angle "," Tag ":" (0054,0200) "," Type ":" 1 "," Attribute Description ":" Position of the detector about the patient for the start of this rotation, in degrees. Zero degrees is referenced to the origin at the patient's back. Viewing from the patient's feet, angle increases in a counter-clockwise direction (detector normal rotating from the patient's back towards the patient's left side). "},{" Attribute Name ":" >Angular Step "," Tag ":" (0018,1144) "," Type ":" 1 "," Attribute Description ":" The angular scan arc step between views of the TOMO acquisition, in degrees. See  for further explanation. "},{" Attribute Name ":" >Rotation Direction "," Tag ":" (0018,1140) "," Type ":" 1 "," Attribute Description ":" Direction of rotation of the detector about the patient. See Start Angle (0054,0200) for further explanation of direction.  Enumerated Values:  CW  clockwise (decreasing angle)    CC  counter-clockwise (increasing angle).    "},{" Attribute Name ":" >Scan Arc "," Tag ":" (0018,1143) "," Type ":" 1 "," Attribute Description ":" The effective angular range of the scan data in degrees. The value shall be positive.
