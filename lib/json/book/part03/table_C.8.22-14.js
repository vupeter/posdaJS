Shall be relative to the same reference point for all frames in this SOP Instance, but may be different from the reference point in other SOP Instances. Positions as the table moves into the gantry viewed from the front are more negative.    For contiguous slices reconstructed from multiple detectors one would expect different values for adjacent slices.   Lateral positioning or tilting or swiveling are not described.
