Shall be consistent with any laterality information contained in Primary Anatomic Structure Modifier Sequence (0008,2230), if present.  Laterality (0020,0060) is a Series level Attribute and must be the same for all Images in the Series, hence it must be absent.  "},{" Attribute Name ":"  Include    "," Tag ":" Defined CID for the Anatomic Region Sequence is 4009 for humans, and 7482 for animals. This is the anatomic region that is placed on the table or bucky for examination.
