The order of pixels sent for each image plane is left to right, top to bottom, i.e., the upper left pixel (labeled 1,1) is sent first followed by the remainder of row 1, followed by the first pixel of row 2 (labeled 2,1) then the remainder of row 2 and so on. "},{" Attribute Name ":" Pixel Aspect Ratio "," Tag ":" (0028,0034) "," Type ":" 1C "," Attribute Description ":" Ratio of the vertical size and horizontal size of the pixels in the image specified by a pair of integer values where the first value is the vertical pixel size, and the second value is the horizontal pixel size. Required if the aspect ratio values do not have a ratio of 1:1 and the physical pixel spacing is not specified by Pixel Spacing (0028,0030), or Imager Pixel Spacing (0018,1164) or Nominal Scanned Pixel Spacing (0018,2010), either for the entire Image or per-frame in a Functional Group Macro.

"},{" Attribute Name ":" Float Pixel Padding Value "," Tag ":" (0028,0122) "," Type ":" 3 "," Attribute Description ":" One limit (inclusive) of a range of pixel values used in an image to pad to rectangular format or to signal background that may be suppressed. "},{" Attribute Name ":" Float Pixel Padding Range Limit "," Tag ":" (0028,0124) "," Type ":" 1C "," Attribute Description ":" Pixel value that represents one limit (inclusive) of a range of padding values used together with Float Pixel Padding Value (0028,0122). Required if Float Pixel Padding Value (0028,0122) is present.    If only a single padding value rather than a range is required, then both Float Pixel Padding Value (0028,0122) and Float Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0124) will contain the same value.   The general considerations described in  may be helpful in understanding the corresponding floating point attributes, but are not normative.    "}];
