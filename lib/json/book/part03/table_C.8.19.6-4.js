Only a single Item shall be included in this Sequence. "},{" Attribute Name ":" >Frame Type "," Tag ":" (0008,9007) "," Type ":" 1 "," Attribute Description ":" Type of Frame. A multi-valued attribute analogous to Image Type (0008,0008). Enumerated Values and Defined Terms are the same as those for the values of Image Type (0008,0008). See . "},{" Attribute Name ":" >Pixel Intensity Relationship "," Tag ":" (0028,1040) "," Type ":" 1 "," Attribute Description ":" The relationship between the Pixel and the X-Ray beam intensity. See . "},{" Attribute Name ":" >Pixel Intensity Relationship Sign "," Tag ":" (0028,1041) "," Type ":" 1 "," Attribute Description ":" The sign of the relationship between the Pixel sample values stored in Pixel Data (7FE0,0010) and the X-Ray beam intensity.  Enumerated Values:  +1  Lower pixel values correspond to less X-Ray beam intensity    -1  Higher pixel values correspond to less X-Ray beam intensity    See  for further explanation. "},{" Attribute Name ":" >Imager Pixel Spacing "," Tag ":" (0018,1164) "," Type ":" 1C "," Attribute Description ":" Physical distance measured at the receptor plane of the detector between the centers of each pixel specified by a numeric pair - row spacing value (delimiter) column spacing value in mm. See  for further explanation of the value order. The value of this attribute shall never be adjusted to account for calibration against an object of known size; Pixel Spacing (0028,0030) is specified for that purpose. It is only allowed to be adjusted to compensate for the change of the Field of View Dimension(s) in Float (0018,9461) attribute. See   Required if Image Type (0008,0008) Value 1 equals ORIGINAL. May be present otherwise.  These values are the actual pixel spacing distances of the stored pixel values of an image.  "},{" Attribute Name ":" >Pixel Data Area Origin Relative To FOV "," Tag ":" (0018,7036) "," Type ":" 3 "," Attribute Description ":" Offset of the TLHC of the image stored in Pixel Data (7FE0,0010) from the TLHC of the Field Of View Area after FOV rotation and Flip. It is measured in image stored pixels as a row offset followed by a column offset.  Due to the differences in image stored pixel and detector element spacing, one may expect this attribute to have non-integer values.  See . "},{" Attribute Name ":" >Pixel Data Area Rotation Angle Relative To FOV "," Tag ":" (0018,7038) "," Type ":" 3 "," Attribute Description ":" Angle clockwise of the row direction of the image stored in Pixel Data (7FE0,0010) relative to the row direction of the Field Of View Area after FOV rotation and Flip. It is measured in degrees. See .
