Required if this differs from the natural interpretation.  Interpretation and representation of RGB images rely on the assumption that the red channel really contains the red wavelength range of illumination light, the blue channel the blue wavelength range, etc. Some modalities use the RGB Photometric Interpretation as a container representing 3 channels of any illumination wavelength.
